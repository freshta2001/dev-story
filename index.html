This is my developer story. 

When I was a child , I had no idea about computers but my brothers were playing games on their computers all the time and I loved looking at them.
When I was 12 years old, I started working with Aria Tv as a children’s program host, everything there was managed by computers and that made me interested in learning computers. 
At that time I had no chance to learn computers till I graduated from school and I asked my family to buy a laptop for me. 
My mom bought a laptop for me and she told me to start learning computers because this world is the world of technology and computers.
I started playing games, watching movies and listening to music with my first  computer for the first time and I was super happy .
After that, for some reason, we had to leave our country many times and this made me fail to learn computers.
Now I found Refcode and this is the best chance for me to learn computers and I’m  happy that I can improve myself to learn coding.
